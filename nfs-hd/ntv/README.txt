The ntv.sage file contains an implementation of the sieve algorithms described
in the article
  L. Gr√©my. Higher dimensional sieving for the number field sieve algorithms,
  ANTS XIII. (available at: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/967)

The benchmarks to reproduce the results for both the accuracy and the running
time of the algorithms are given in the beginning of the file.
