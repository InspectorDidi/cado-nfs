Quick install:
==============

in most cases the following should work to factor the number 903...693
using two cores:

1) make
2) ./factor.sh 90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693 -t 2

More details follow.

Important note: For a larger factorization (distributed on several machines),
please use directly the main script scripts/cadofactor/cadofactor.py (whose
documentation is in scripts/cadofactor/README, and documented example parameter
files are in params/params.c90 and scripts/cadofactor/parameters) instead of
factor.sh (see section "Run a factorization on current machine").

Supported platforms:
====================

 - The primary development platform is x86_64 linux with gcc 4.4 or
   later, the most common processor being Intel core2-like. Other 64-bit
   microarchitectures and processors are checked regularly.

Anything else than the primary platform perhaps works, perhaps does not work.

 - Mac OS X Mavericks and Mountain Lion have been successfully tested with both
   Apple's gcc and clang. (see local.sh.macosx.x86_64) 

 - Max OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard have been tested to work at
   least once, provided some additional tools and libraries (see below) have
   been installed, notably for Leopard. ABI selection is sometimes tricky. (see
   local.sh.macosx.x86_32)


 - 32-bit linux with gcc-4.4 or later is supposed to work.

 - Windows is only partly supported (see a longer note at the end of this file).

Required software tools:
========================

*) GMP (http://gmplib.org): usually installed in most Linux distributions
   (on some Linux distributions you need to install libgmp*-dev
    including gmp.h, which is not installed by default).
    Note: make sure to configure GMP with --enable-shared so that a shared
    library is installed (libgmp.so under Linux) otherwise CADO-NFS might not
    compile. GMP 5 (or newer) is required. On some platforms, --disable-alloca
    is required to get thread-safe operations.
*) The GCC compiler works ; some others might, but it is untested. C and
   C++ are required, with C99 support.
*) GNU make and CMake for building (CMake is installed on the fly if missing
   (requires an Internet connection))
*) Support for posix threads.
*) The main cadofactor.py script uses a lot of unix tools: Python3, ssh,
   rsync, gzip, and libsqlite3 to mention but a few. For more information
   about the supported Python versions and required modules, see
   README.Python.

Optionally:
*) Support for curl library.
*) Support for MPI (see local.sh.example and linalg/bwc/README)


Configure
=========

Normally you have nothing to do to configure cado-nfs.

However if your site needs tweaks, set such tweaks using environment variables,
or via the shell script local.sh ; you may start with

cp local.sh.example local.sh

Edit according to your local settings and your taste: local.sh.example
gives documentation on the recognized environment variables and their effect.

Note that tweaks in local.sh are global (relevant to all sub-directories
of the cado-nfs tree, not to a particular directory).

As a rule of thumb, whenever you happen to modify the local.sh script, it
is advised to trigger re-configuration of the build system, by the
special command ``make cmake''. Another way to achieve the same goal is
to remove the build tree, which is below build/ (normally named as the
hostname of the current machine).

Optional (alternative): configure using cmake directly
======================================================

cado-nfs includes a top-level Makefile which builds the binary objects in
a special build directory which is below build/ (normally named as the
hostname of the current machine). This way, parralel builds for different
machines may coexist on one shared directory. This is sort of a magic
``out-of-source'' build.

Another way to do ``out-of-source'' build is to create a separate build
directory and build from there, by calling cmake directly for the
configuration. This proceeds as follows:

mkdir /some/build/directory
cd /some/build/directory
cmake /path/to/cado-nfs/source/tree

Note however that in this case, the local.sh file found in the source
tree is not read (but you may elect to do so before calling cmake).

Compile:
========

make

Install:
========

The relevance of the ``make install'' step depends on the platform.
Cado-nfs binaries link to shared libraries, and some do so dynamically.
For this to work, we rely on some control logic by cmake and cooperation
with the operating system's dynamic linker.

Calling one of cado-nfs scripts (e.g. factor.sh) can be done in
several ways. Here we assume that $SRCDIR is the source directory, that
$BUILDDIR is the build tree for the local machine (typically
$SRCDIR/`hostname`), and that $PREFIX is the installation prefix (by
default, $SRCDIR/installed). We refer to these different ways, and later
discuss how they work on different systems (which is mostly impacted by
the shared library mechanism).

(1) $SRCDIR/factor.sh
    This deduces $BUILDDIR from the machine hostname, and amounts to
    calling binaries from there. Parameter files are obtained from
    $SRCDIR.

(2) $BUILDDIR/factor.sh
    This calls binaries from $BUILDDIR, and loads parameter files from
    $SRCDIR

(3) $PREFIX/bin/factor.sh
    This calls binaries from $PREFIX/bin, and loads parameter files from
    $PREFIX/share/cado-nfs-2.1.1/examples

Linux, BSD: All three methods work
MacOS X:
    For any invocation to work, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    variable must be set up properly. The easiest method is to do make
    install, and include in these environment variables the directory
    $PREFIX/lib/cado-nfs-2.1.1.

Run a factorization on current machine:
=======================================

./factor.sh 90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693 -t 2

where the option '-t 2' tells how many cores (via threads) to use on the
current machine (for polynomial selection, sieving and linear algebra).

CADO-NFS is optimized only for numbers above 85 digits, and no support will
be provided for numbers of less than 59 digits. Note that it is a good idea
to remove small prime factors using special-purpose algorithms such as trial
division, P-1, P+1, or ECM, and use CADO-NFS only for the remaining composite
factor.

./factor.sh 353493749731236273014678071260920590602836471854359705356610427214806564110716801866803409 -t 2 -s 2

If the number of cores is greater than 2, it is more efficient to use multiple
clients with -s to distribute the polynomial selection and sieve on the current
machine. This example uses two clients, which use two threads each.
If the number of cores is greater than 4, it is very recommended (sometimes
mandatory if the script crashes) to use multiple clients.

Run a factorization on several machines:
=======================================

./factor.sh 353493749731236273014678071260920590602836471854359705356610427214806564110716801866803409 -t 2 -s 2 -h hostname1,hostname2,hostname3

This starts 2 clients each on hosts hostname1, hostname2, and hostname3,
where each client uses two cpus (threads). For hostnames that are not
localhost, ssh is used to connect to the host and start a client there.
To configure ssh, see the next section.

For a larger factorization (distributed on several machines, possibly
with different parameters for different machines), please use directly
the main script cadofactor.py (doc included in
scripts/cadofactor/README and scripts/cadofactor/parameters).

Check that your SSH configuration is correct:
=============================================

The master script uses SSH to connect to available computing resources.
In order to avoid the script asking your password or passphrase, you must
have public-key authentication and an agent.

The SSH keys are usually installed in the files ~/.ssh/id_rsa and
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub; if you don't have them yet, you can create them with the
ssh-keygen command. See the man page ssh-keygen(1) for details. The private
key should be protected with a passphrase, which you can enter when you
create the keys. Normally ssh will ask for the key's passphrase when you log
on to a machine, but this can be avoided by using ssh-agent, see the man
page ssh-agent(1), and providing the passphrase to the agent with ssh-add.
Public-key authenticaton together with an ssh-agent will allow cadofactor
to use ssh to run commands on slave machines automatically.

Most of the recent Linux distributions will run an ssh-agent for you. But
if this is not the case with your distribution, or if you are running
cadofactor.py inside a ``screen'' in order to logout of your desktop, you
will need to run the ssh-agent by hand. As a short recipe, you can type:
   eval `ssh-agent`
   ssh-add

You should also copy your public key, i.e., the contents of the file 
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, into $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys on the slave machines, to
allow logging in with public-key authentication.

Also, since localhost has an IP and key that varies, you should have
those 3 lines in your $HOME/.ssh/config:

Host    localhost
        StrictHostKeyChecking no
        UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null

If everything is correctly configured, when you type

ssh localhost

you should end up with a new shell on your machine, without having to
type any password/passphrase.


Restarting an interrupted factorization:
========================================

If you have started a factorization with the cadofactor.py script, and it was
interrupted (for example because of a power failure) you can restart it simply
with the same cadofactor.py command line.

Factoring with SNFS:
====================

It is possible to take advantage of the special form of an integer and
use the Special Number Field Sieve. See the doc in
params/parameters.F9 for that. Note in particular that you can force
the special-q to be on the rational side if this is more appropriate
for your number, with tasks.sieve.ratq=True on the factor.sh or
cadofactor.py command line.

The default square root algorithm does not work in some very rare cases
that could possibly occur with SNFS polynomials (a degree 4 polynomial
with Galois group Z/2 x Z/2 is the only reasonable example, next case is
for degree 8). The CRT approach is a workaround. See crtaglsqrt.c .

Big factorization (more than 200 digits):
=========================================
By default, to decrease memory usage, it is assumed than less than 2^32 (~ four
billion) relations or ideals are needed and that the ideals will be less than
2^32 (i.e. the lpba/lpbr parameters are less or equal to 32). In the case of
factorizations of number of more than 200 digits, these assumptions may not
hold. In this case, you have to set some variables in your local.sh script
(see Configure section above for more information on local.sh and section on big
factorization in local.sh.example).

Factoring with two non-linear polynomials:
==========================================

You can find a bit of information on this topic in the development version,
in the GIT repository (see file README.nonlinear).

Importing polynomials or relations:
===================================

If you have already computed a good polynomial and/or relations, you can
tell CADO-NFS to use them, see scripts/cadofactor/README.

Using CADO-NFS under Windows:
=============================

Portability of CADO-NFS on Windows was not an initial goal of that project,
however we give here some hints that might help people wanting to use CADO-NFS
under Windows:

* if you only need the siever to run on Windows, then you only need to compile
  the "las" program on Windows.

* CygWin provides a Unix-like environment, where compilation should be easy.
  However the binary requires a cygwin.dll file. We have been told of problems
  with shared libraries, the following solves this problem:
  PATH="installed/lib/cado-nfs-2.1.1:$PATH" ./factor.sh [...]

* if you want a binary without any dependency, you might try MinGW. The INSTALL
  file from GNU MPFR contains detailed instructions on how to compile MPFR
  under Windows. Those instructions should work for CADO-NFS too.
  See dev_docs/howto-MinGW.txt. Complilation on MinGW32 is tested regularly
  and should work, although performance of the 32-bit executables is poor.

* you might try to use MPIR (mpir.org) instead of GMP. MPIR is a fork of GMP,
  which claims to be more portable under Windows.

* you might succeed in compiling the cado-nfs binaries with a
  cross-compiler for windows (which does not waive the runtime
  requirements for cadofactor.py, notably on unix-like utilities). See
  dev_docs/README.cross in the source code repository for information on
  how to cross-compile.

Known problems:
===============

* GCC 4.1.2 is known to miscompile CADO-NFS (see
  https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=14490),
  GCC 4.2.0, 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 are also affected
* under NetBSD 5.1 amd64, Pthreads in the linear algebra step seem not to
  work, please use -t 1 option in factor.sh or
  tasks.linalg.threads=1x1 cadofactor.py.
* under AIX, if GMP is compiled in 64-bit mode, you should set the
  environment variable OBJECT_MODE, for example:
  export OBJECT_MODE=64
