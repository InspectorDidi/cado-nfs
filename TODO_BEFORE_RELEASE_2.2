[ ] Edit NEWS to report what we have changed.

[ ] Get rid of factor.sh

  - cadofactor.py (maybe move it at the top-level of the source tree)
    should take care of finding parameter files, creating a working
    directory, and so on.
  - abandon the idea of copying cadofactor.py to the build-tree.
  - allow a bindir=.... option to tell which build-tree to use.
  - by default, use the last one known to cmake (or local.sh?);
    for that, run eval `call_cmake.sh show`.
  - don't forget to have all of this functional after make install.
  - try to avoid to copy many scripts in the build-tree.
  - don't forget to update the doc accordingly (in many, many places)

[ ] Have correctly tuned parameter files
  - only up to 155 digits, by step of 5, starting from 60
    sample files cxxx.poly created, missing: c145, c150, c155
    tuning with OPAL remains to be done for: c135, c140, c145, c155
  - want a larger size? see customer service!

[X] Officially support DLP in GF(p)

  - ship parameter file for p155 + hintfile
  - review documentation

[ ] Fix memory issue in las

  - evaluation of weight of the buckets is still wrong

[ ] Delete dead code

[ ] Decide about "supported platforms", and update README and webpage

[ ] Check the list of bugs and feature requests

[ ] Update the timings on the web page and check we have no regression
