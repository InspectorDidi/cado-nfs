[X] Remove forbw option (hard-code forbw=3) and rename coverNmax into
    target_density

[ ] Edit NEWS to report what we have changed.

[x] Get rid of factor.sh

  - the toplevel script is now cado-nfs.py (cadofactor.py has moved). It 
    takes care of finding parameter files, creating a working
    directory, and so on.
  - cado-nfs.py and cado-nfs-client.py are still copied to the build
    tree, but not with the purpose of allowing to run the scripts from
    there.
  - by default, the binaries whose location is given by "make show" are
    chosen.
  - this is supposed to work also after make install, including with
    shared libraries set up (provided by give a slaves.bindir option)

[ ] Have correctly tuned parameter files
  - only up to 155 digits, by step of 5, starting from 60
    sample files cxxx.poly created, missing: c145, c150, c155
    tuning with OPAL remains to be done for: c135, c140, c145, c155
  - want a larger size? see customer service!

[X] Officially support DLP in GF(p)

  - ship parameter file for p155 + hintfile
  - review documentation

[ ] Fix memory issue in las

  - evaluation of weight of the buckets is still wrong

[ ] Delete dead code

[ ] Decide about "supported platforms", and update README and webpage
